    "## Describing the dataset\n",
    "[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a website where you can ask and answer software related questions. It is a platform where millions of programmers, software developers, software engineers, etc. meet every day to learn form each other. Stack Overflow itself is aware of the enormous popularity of their platform and for this reason they keep a annual survey to get general insight about the average software engineer in relation to his/her field of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year the results of the survey will get published on their website (cleaned and in csv format). Multiple datasets (one for each year since 2015) are available for analysis. For this project the survey results of 2018 will be used exclusively. The main reason for this choice is recency and the completeness of the results. The 2018 survey results were filled in by around 100.000 software developers, most of which answered 129 different questions. These questions are about job satisfaction, salary, favourite programming languages, weekly exercise, company size, etc. This large variety of questions provides a source of interesting research opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source of the dataset**<br />\n",
    "Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2018 (186 MB): https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data description:**<br />\n",
    "The Stack Overflow survey results of 2018 has in total 98855 rows and 129 columns. Some of these columns consist of only numerical data, like: 'Salary' and 'ConvertedSalary'. All the other columns are categorical. The categorical columns are devidable over three types of columns:\n",
    "- Values denoted in text. E.g. 'Yes', 'No', 'United States', 'Employed part-time', etc.\n",
    "- Values denoted in ';' seperated lists. E.g. 'Python;Java;C#', 'Windows;Linux;, etc.\n",
    "- Values denoted in numbers. E.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. (for rankings)\n",
    "\n",
    "Textual input can't be interpreted easily by the average Machine Learning algorithm. Therefore, preprocessing of the original dataset is needed, so it can be used for further analysis. A [notebook](./dataset_preprocessing.ipynb) is created that is dedicted to preprocessing the Stack Overflow survey dataset in the following ways:\n",
    "- Drop rows with missing values in the column 'JobSatisfaction'. The column 'JobSatisfaction' is the target value that will be used for analysis. It is not desirable to have missing values for a target feature, because the value NaN doesn't refer to valid classification value.\n",
    "- Drop unimportant columns. Some columns can be left out because they have no correlation with the target column 'JobSatisfaction', are redundant or have too many missing values (80%).\n",
    "- Preprocess values dentoed in ';' seperated lists. List values such as 'Python;Java;C#' can't be used as input for a Machine Learning algorithm. First, the value has to be numerical. Second, numerification of the ';' value as is will result a unique class for every unique list. It is instead needed to get a unique class for every language present in the list.\n",
    "- Encode text to numerical values. Text isn't easy to interpret for Machine Learning algorithms. To solve this problem all text-formatted values will be converted to numerical values.\n",
    "- (optional) Impute missing values. A lot of data is missing, this missing data can be imputed with statistical values (e.g. mean, mode, etc.). Both the imputed and not-imputed dataset will be used in the analysis. (The one that will perform better will be chosen)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above steps will result in a preprocessed data set with 69276 rows and 410 columns.<br />\n",
    "The data will be tranformed as follows:<br />\n",

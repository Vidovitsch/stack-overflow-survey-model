    "I'm using the survey results of the Stack Overflow survey of 2018. The results of the survey mainly consists of categorical answers on questions like: 'Do you write code as a hobby?' or 'How many times do you exercise each week?'. Before I can use Machine Learning, I have to change all the results to numerical values. I'll also get rid of most of the missing values, because the average Machine Learning algorithm doesn't like these."

    "#### Convert ';' seperated values to binarized representation\n",
    "List values such as $'Python;Java;C#'$ can't be used as input for a Machine Learning algorithm. First, the value has to be numerical. Second, numerification of the ';' values as is will result a unique class for every unique list. It is instead needed to get a unique class for every language present in the list.<br><br>\n",
    "To do this I use the *MultiLabelBinarizer* algorithm from the *sklearn.preprocessing* library. This algorithm converts values like $[['Python', 'Java', 'C#'], ['Python', 'C#']]$ to the following representation: $[[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1]]$ with the columns 'Python', 'Java' and 'C#'. This way the the values will be converted to a $0$ or a $1$ for each row, which is readable for a Machine Learning algorithm."
